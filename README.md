Azure Data Lake Storage Lifecycle Management

Overview

This repository contains the lifecycle management policy for Azure Data Lake Storage, designed to automate the transition of data across different storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive) and eventually delete it after a specified duration. The lifecycle is maintained with a 365-day interval between each transition, ensuring cost-effective storage management.

Features

	•	Automated Tier Transitions:
	•	Hot to Cool Tier: Data is moved to the cool tier if it has not been modified in the last 365 days.
	•	Cool to Archive Tier: Data is moved to the archive tier 365 days after being moved to the cool tier.
	•	Archive Deletion: Data in the archive tier is automatically deleted after 365 days of inactivity.
	•	Cost Efficiency:
	•	Reduces storage costs by moving less frequently accessed data to lower-cost tiers.
	•	Ensures data retention policies are enforced automatically.

Lifecycle Policy Details

The lifecycle policy is defined in a JSON format and includes the following rules:

	1.	Move to Cool Tier:
	•	Criteria: Data not modified in the last 365 days.
	•	Action: Transition data from the hot tier to the cool tier.
	
	2.	Move to Archive Tier:
	•	Criteria: Data not modified in the last 730 days.
	•	Action: Transition data from the cool tier to the archive tier.
	
	3.	Delete Archived Data:
	•	Criteria: Data not modified in the last 1095 days.
	•	Action: Permanently delete data from the archive tier.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

	•	An Azure account with access to Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
	•	Proper permissions to manage storage account policies.

Deployment

	1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/azure-datalake-lifecycle-management.git
cd azure-datalake-lifecycle-management

	2.	Edit the Policy (Optional):
	•	Modify the lifecycle-policy.json file to adjust the prefix, blob types, or time intervals according to your needs.
	3.	Deploy the Policy:
	•	Use the Azure CLI, Azure Portal, or an ARM template to apply the lifecycle management policy to your storage account.
Example using Azure CLI:

az storage account management-policy create \
  --account-name <YourStorageAccountName> \
  --policy @lifecycle-policy.json

  Monitoring and Maintenance

	•	Azure Monitor: Set up monitoring and alerts to track the effectiveness of the lifecycle policies.
	•	Cost Management: Use Azure Cost Management tools to evaluate the impact of the lifecycle policies on your storage costs.
